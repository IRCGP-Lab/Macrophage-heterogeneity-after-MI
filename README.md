Title: Single-cell transcriptomics unveils the spatiotemporal dynamics of macrophage heterogeneity and a potential role of Trem2hi macrophages in infarcted hearts

Contents: The R scripts required for analysis of the single-cell RNA-sequencing and spatial transcriptome sequencing dataset.

Data Availability: The scRNA-seq and ST-seq data sets generated in this study were deposited in Gene Expression Omnibus under the accession numbers [GSE163129](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE163129) and [GSE165857](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE165857), respectively.
Sequencing reads were mapped to the mm10 version 3.0.0 reference, downloaded from the 10x Genomics (https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/software/downloads/latest). 

Packages: The analysis scripts written in R programming language use the following packages:
Seurat, SingleR, SeuratWrappers, monocle3, reticulate, Matrix, gplot2, cowplot, magrittr, patchwork, dplyr, RColorBrewer, SPOTlight
